				<p>Last week, The Hustler published an article examining the prevalence of eating disorders on campus (“A culture of disordered eating,” March 26). The article highlighted the high stress college environment that compounds with body-image issues to produce a struggle that is both physical and mental. The article concluded with a section examining whether or not Vanderbilt is equipped to handle these issues (conclusion: it isn’t) and addressed what seems to me to be a fundamental problem underlying campus life: the growing struggle of providing support for students suffering from mental health issues.</p>
				<p>This article was not the first time I had seen concern expressed over the services offered for struggling students on campus. Many of my peers have turned to the PCC for a variety of reasons, and while some have reported success, many have also expressed dissatisfaction with the way their concerns were handled. As the eating disorders article suggested, many have sought off-campus options for treatment when their needs could not be met here. However, this option is not available to many students due to financial concerns and lack of transportation.</p>
				<p>I understand that struggle. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Though the severity had lessened over the years, during my first year at Vanderbilt, I experienced a few lapses and decided to contact the PCC. During my initial visit, I talked with a therapist who discussed a couple of different treatment options; however, she repeatedly emphasized that group therapy for stress management was the preferred option. As a strongly introverted individual, I was not sure that group therapy would be ideal, but I put my trust in psychological professionals. However, at the same time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was just another folder to be filed away. </p>			
				<p>During therapy, I found that the techniques and topics they discussed were things I had already heard. Stress management is a valuable skill, but it did not address the core of my problem. After a few weeks, I stopped attending, and there was no follow-up. Though I saw improvement with my own anxiety, this natural reversal does not go so well for each individual. Many sufferers of mental health issues enjoy periods of relative stability, only to find themselves diving into worse relapses.</p> 
				<p>Now, don’t get me wrong — brief observational data and anecdotal evidence do not constitute a fully substantiated, scientific claim. But it seems, given the evidence, that Vanderbilt is not alone. The increasing prevalence of mental health issues among college students around the country has been a source of major concern in recent years. A June 2013 Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors survey examined the incidence of students reporting anxiety, depression and other psychological problems. Of the directors surveyed, 70 percent reported an increase in students experiencing severe mental health issues. More importantly, 19 percent also reported that the services offered by their institutions were not sufficient to meet the needs of the campus population. Perhaps the most staggering of these statistics came from a report issued from a 2012 National Alliance on Mental Illness survey: Of those experiencing mental health concerns, nearly three-quarters experienced a crisis on campus, yet 34 percent did not disclose their struggle to their college. Of those who did, the majority expressed the view that their college’s response was only “good” or “fair.” Few categorized it as “excellent.”</p>
				<p>The student response to mental health services here on campus shows a disturbing distrust of the organizations meant to provide outreach and support for struggling students. The fault lies not with the organization itself, but with the culture that stigmatizes mental illness and brushes it under the rug, not realizing the impact it has on students’ ability to succeed and prosper as mental health resources continue to be underfunded. As top-tier students at a well-respected university, we are one of its most precious resources. But if we allow these struggles to go unnoticed and these cries for help to go unanswered, we are losing the potential of many bright, dedicated students who need just a bit more time and attention to get back on their feet.</p>
				<p>With more than 12,000 students in a high-stress environment like Vanderbilt, students are bound to have their ups and downs, moments of panic and triumph, in equal measure. But when this natural cycle is put out of balance, it falls to those in power to recognize that needs are not being met. Vanderbilt boasts one of the leading medical facilities in the country. It is time that our commitment to health and wellness was turned toward improving the mental health of the student body and assuring that they receive the support they need.</p>
