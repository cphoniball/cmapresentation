				<h4><strong>PCC director clarifies approach to eating-disorder case management</strong></h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				<p>When Director Catherine Fuchs joined the Psychological Counseling Center in August 2012, she set out to coordinate and offer additional training to teams taking care of students suffering with eating disorders. Fuchs led a study team of representatives from different disciplines at the counseling center in a literature review, which examined both standard cases as well as cases presenting with comorbidities (additional disorders). The study team's findings resulted in the PCC's current treatment process for students with eating disorders.</p>
				<p>In Fuchs' approach to eating disorders, she emphasizes the illnesses' complexity and how it affects the treatment process.
				“These are complex illnesses and require a multidisciplinary approach," she said. "They also require a multimodal approach, meaning different forms of intervention, and that's why we have the individual and the group and the different types of individual therapy and the different types of group therapy. And that complexity requires a really good assessment and then figuring out the treatment."</p>
				<p>The Hustler asked some additional questions to allow Dr. Fuchs to clarify the process further.</p>
				<p><strong>The Vanderbilt Hustler:</strong> What is the general approach to eating-disorder treatment? </p>
				<p><strong>Catherine Fuchs:</strong> "The term ‘eating disorders’ refers to a very broad spectrum of disorders. Within those categories, we see students who are early in their phase of an eating disorder, we see students who have had struggles with their eating disorder for years through their adolescence and into college, and we see varying degrees of severity as well as degrees of insight. When you talk about treatment for eating disorders, you have to talk about it as a range of needs. When you look at a range of needs of any type of illness, then you've got a need for a core intervention. On some levels, (there is) a need for consultation outside the system or use of resources outside the system. A student who is seeking an intensity of care that might include twice-a-week therapy is an intensity of care that requires using the community resources, because that's an individual with a potentially more severe chronic or severe eating disorder. We might partner with people who are members of the Eating Disorder Coalition – therapists within the community who are members of the Eating Disorder Coalition – to make sure we have the breadth of services that that student might need."</p> 
				<p><strong>VH: </strong>How is the system of care decided? </p>
				<p><strong>CF: </strong>“It's not ‘one size fits all.’ We needed to really tailor the treatment to the individual needs of the student. We developed a protocol that requires an initial assessment of treatment planning process. We spend the first one to three meeting with that student getting information and identifying what is the most appropriate treatment plan. </p>
				<p>“At the core, what we provide here is individual therapy every other week with a focus on psychoeducation or coping skills or ACT therapy (acceptance and commitment therapy) or one of the others, but with group therapy as a collaborative process, so if you think about it, someone's getting group therapy weekly and individual therapy every other week and meeting with the nutritionist once a month at Student Health and meeting with the physician at Student Health and also meeting with our med provider here if they're on meds, then they may be getting in the course of four weeks eight to ten appointments. So even though it may not be weekly individual psychotherapy, it is a team-approach that provides a safety net for that student. We have some students who do come weekly for individual therapy initially so we do the assessment, we meet with them weekly to provide the ACT therapy or psychodynamic therapy, but if they're at a level where they need skills training, then we're going to see them every other week while they get the skills training, so it's not just that we think that's good enough. It's because we're creating a treatment plan based upon the presentation, and so there are some students who are seen weekly because that's where they are in the course of this protocol. Then we have students who will say, 'I need to be seen twice a week.' But that's where we then have to step up to using collaboration within the community because the system here is designed to take care of the majority and it's the minority that need that twice-a-week therapy."</p>
