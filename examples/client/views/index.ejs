					<h4 class="article-subhead">Disordered eating in college</h4>
					<p>The Eating Disorder Coalition of Tennessee hosted a charity walk at Centennial Park on Saturday, as part of the National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, benefitting the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA). It is a particularly important cause to junior Bailey Monarch, who participated in the event and helped raise more than $1,300 for the organization.</p>
					<p>Having coordinated over three walks for NEDA in her hometown of Tampa during high school, Monarch has always been close to the cause and has continued to support it in her college years as well. Majoring in HOD in the pre-nursing program, she has noted the prevalence of eating disorders at Vanderbilt.</p>
					<p>Monarch said, “It’s really, really heartbreaking, and I definitely think that there are a lot of factors that go into that.”</p>
					<p>Monarch feels that the general pressure felt by students on campus to look and act a certain way is a main cause for eating disorders at Vanderbilt.</p>
					<p>“I think one of them would be just the stressful environment that a lot of people experience while at Vanderbilt,” Monarch said. “And a lot of times eating disorders can develop when people are really stressed and feel as if a lot of aspects of their life are out of control and food is the one thing that they can control.”</p>
					<p>And when things are spinning out of control, sometimes people don’t even notice the unhealthy behaviors they are engaging in.</p>

					<blockquote class="text-center">“A lot of times people don’t realize what has happened and is happening until they’re deep within the throes of their eating disorder.” 
						<cite>Bailey Monarch</cite>
					</blockquote>

					<p>Go Figure, the student organization committed to promoting a positive body image, was also represented at the walk. Sophomore Kelly Tieu, a representative for the organization, has experienced and witnessed the effects of the culture around disordered eating at Vanderbilt.</p>
					<p>“It affects the way people see themselves, the way that it affects their self-confidence and the way that we talk about body image around campus really affects that as well — the ‘Oh my God I feel fat today’ or ‘Do I look fat in this?’” Tieu said.</p>

							<h5>What is disordered eating?</h5>
							<p>Disordered eating is a term used to describe behavior that embodies only some of the symptoms of an eating disorder.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>This type of negative-self talk is often associated with disordered eating. According to the National Eating Disorder Information Center (NEDIC), the general definition of disordered eating includes "a wide range of abnormal eating." It manifests itself through behaviors seen in disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia that nevertheless do not warrant an eating-disorder diagnosis. An eating-disorder diagnosis is only warranted when a certain number of symptoms are expressed, but if a person only shows certain aspects of the disease, they are seen as having disordered eating habits*. 
						<div class="aside right col-md-3">
							*Examples of disordered eating behaviors might include self-induced vomiting, skipping meals or unbalanced eating (for example, restricting a major food group such as "fatty" foods or carbohydrates).

					<p>Cindy Green, the head of the eating disorder treatment team at the Psychological Counseling Center, feels that the best thing would be to intervene when the illness is in its developmental stages.</p>
					<p>“I would love it if somebody came and said, ‘You know what, I’ve been going on a diet and I’m realizing that things have been drifting in a not great direction, so I’d really like to work on that.’ That would be ideal,” Green said.</p>

					<p>Green considers eating disorders themselves as coping mechanisms that work until they don’t.</p> 
					<p>Green said, “That’s (anorexia nervosa) an eating disorder where there is a lot of ... confusion in the person’s mind about whether this is actually a problem or not. It’s like, ‘No, this is working great; being thin is what makes me happy — being even thinner would make me even happier.’ …The thing about an eating disorder is that it can give you a sense of control at a time in your life when you feel out of control about almost everything else.”</p>
					<p>According to national statistics, college-aged girls are the most at-risk group for developing an eating disorder, often as a result of the stress from transitioning from high school into the more competitive collegiate setting.</p>
					<figure>

					</figure> 
					<p>According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, “25% of college-aged women engage in bingeing and purging as a weight-management technique, and 91% of women surveyed on a college campus had attempted to control their weight through dieting.”</p>
					<p>Students at an institution like Vanderbilt might be particularly vulnerable to developing eating disorders.</p>
					<blockquote class="text-center">“The same perfectionism that made it possible for people to get good enough grades to get into Vanderbilt in the first place also makes them at risk for this kind of thing.” 
						<cite>Cindy Green, head of eating disorder treatment</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In Green’s caseload, anorexics are slightly more common because people are more likely to reach out on their behalf as their illness manifests itself more physically. According to her, bulimics are more likely to be at a normal weight and binge-eaters also do not worry other people as much.</p>
					<p>“They’re not walking around ‘looking’ like a disorder,” Green said.</p>
					<p>According to Green, eating disorders in general are becoming more and more prevalent on college campuses nationwide, but Vanderbilt is ahead of the curve by having a more comprehensive treatment program than most colleges and universities, only surpassed by Duke University that has a treatment center directly off-campus.</p>

					<h4 class="article-subhead">Disordered eating across colleges</h4>
					
					<p>The culture of disordered eating is not unique to Vanderbilt. Among the throngs of college girls in sweatshirts and leggings on the Saturday morning NEDA walk were Kathleen Trotter and Aven Chadwell, two Belmont students and survivors of eating disorders who had come to support NEDA because of their own on-campus advocacy work.</p>
					<p>A senior majoring in entertainment industry studies, Trotter said her eating disorder was fixated on control.</p>
					<p>“I knew I was good at restricting calories, I knew exactly how to transform my body, I knew exactly how many calories were in things I was eating and how many steps I could take to burn it all off,” Trotter said. ”So when other things weren’t going my way … for some reason, my solution to those problems, even though it had nothing to do with my grades, would be to lose weight.”</p>
					<p>	Both felt that Belmont students might be particularly affected by eating disorders due to many students’ desire to become employed in the entertainment industry.</p>
					<p>“A lot of people are interested in being part of the music industry and the entertainment industry and that’s an industry that, you know, does place a lot of emphasis on outward appearance,” Trotter said.
					Trotter lauded the university’s approach to inviting events about eating disorders, even if its prevention programming is minimal.</p>
					<p>Chadwell, a recent graduate who studied art history and dance, also praised the level of support she received as an undergraduate at Belmont from peers and faculty alike. When she felt healthy enough to talk about her disorder, she said she was greatly supported by the collegiate community.</p>
					<blockquote class="text-center">“I have just never felt embarrassed speaking out and I think that’s something that is really, really special and partly unique to just what a great job Belmont does at fostering that sense of community and truly sharing a special connection with other students.” 
						<cite>Aven Chadwell</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Chadwell sought treatment immediately upon entering college. After being treated by a general counselor at her high school, she found a specialist at Belmont through the school. She considers herself lucky, but also thinks she is in the minority when it comes to the accessibility of the treatment facilities.</p>
					<p>“I was really lucky to have a counselor that is on the nursing faculty as well as counseling, so I was lucky that I didn’t have to go off campus, and because it was through Belmont I didn’t have to pay for any outside fees,” Chadwell said.</p>

					<h4 class="article-subhead">Problems with Vanderbilt's resources</h4>
					<p>Bailey Monarch opined that she does not consider Vanderbilt’s resources adequate for students struggling with eating disorders.</p>
					<p>“Honestly, I don’t think that the counselors at the PCC are qualified to deal with something as complex as an eating disorder, and, a lot of times, I know (patients) can only see the counselors at the PCC once every other week. A lot of times with eating disorders people need to see counselors at least once a week, maybe several times a week, because the beginning stages of getting treatment, there’s a lot of support that’s needed and a lot of things that need to be addressed,” Monarch said.</p>

					<blockquote>
						“I don’t think that Vanderbilt has adequate resources and seeing a counselor every other week is not enough for that.”
						<cite>Bailey Monarch</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Green does not see a problem with the frequency of appointments with individual counselors when they are supplemented with visits with other healthcare professionals and group therapy where the students practice identifying and dealing with triggers and the subsequent behaviors.</p>
					<p>“I think twice a week might be an overkill anyway, but certainly I have people who I see weekly who are really struggling,” Green said. “Between group and therapy, it would be possible to get treatment twice a week every other week.”</p>
					<p>A student seeking treatment for an eating disorder at Vanderbilt is generally directed to the PCC or the Zerfoss Student Health Center where they will be directed to the other center’s holistic treatment. Besides the team at the PCC, the Student Health Center houses two internists and a nutritionist whose availability has caused some concern. The nutritionist only sees patients for three hours a week at the clinic and works at the Adolescent and Young Adult Eating Disorders Program at Children’s Hospital at 100 Oaks for the rest of the time.</p>
					<p>A lack of resources is a problem for the PCC as there is a tremendous demand on the center. The center encourages patients requiring inpatient or intense outpatient treatment to look elsewhere, although overall Green considers the PCC’s resources usually adequate.</p>
					<p>“I think that if someone needed to be seen more often than seeing a therapist here once a week or every other week, depending on the severity, seeing Janell (Pendergrass, the nutritionist at the Student Health Center), seeing a med provider here, seeing an internist at Student Health — that should be adequate for somebody whose eating disorder isn’t significantly getting in their way,” Green said.</p>
					<p>Monarch advocates that students seek off-campus treatment if the disorder is particularly severe, but says that this is not always an ideal.</p> 
					<p>"Obviously they can go out into the Nashville community but that’s not feasible for some people,” Monarch said. “Freshmen don’t have cars and some people can’t pay for that.”</p>
					<p>Though most can agree that disordered eating is a problem on Vanderbilt’s campus and that there are resources available for recover, a debate still exists whether or not enough is being done for the severest of cases on campus.</p>
